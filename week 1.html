        For this week's assignment, I chose the “ORAL.pub’ site. What initially drew me to this website was the aesthetic and interactivity given to the viewer. The entire site is very artistic and consistent. I enjoy how the moving circles link to other art pieces. 

<p>At first glance, this site makes me feel nostalgic and the vibe it gives off is very ‘Y2K’. It reminds me of old flash games that I would play with. </p>
